# VBA Matrix and Double Utility Classes

This project provides a set of VBA classes and modules for matrix operations and encapsulated double values, suitable for use in Excel or other VBA environments. It is designed for educational, scientific, and engineering applications where matrix computations are required.

## Features

- **XDouble.cls**: A utility class for encapsulating a Double value with additional properties (name, format, unit) and event notification on value changes. Provides formatted string representations and cloning.

- **XMatrix.cls**: A class for matrix operations using XDouble objects. Supports:
  - Matrix allocation and cloning
  - Random matrix generation (integer/double, symmetric/banded)
  - Matrix arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply)
  - LU decomposition and linear system solving
  - Eigenvalue approximation
  - Utility functions (transpose, trace, symmetry check, etc.)

- **Utilities.bas**: Helper functions for generating random numbers (integer and double) within specified bounds.

- **Run.bas**: Example/test module demonstrating usage of the XMatrix and XDouble classes.

## Usage

1. **Import the files** into your VBA project (Excel, Access, etc.).
2. Use the `XMatrixUsageExamples` and `XDoubleUsageExamples` subroutines in `Run.bas` as a starting point to play around and get used to the methods.
3. Extend or modify the classes as needed for your application.
